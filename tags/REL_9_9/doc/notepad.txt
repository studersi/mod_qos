- collecting additional client/connection attributes such as
  - requests per single TCP connection (keep-alive)
  + 304 responses
  + respone content types (html/css/js/image/...)
  - elapse time between requests
  - request/response length (body)
  - request/response headers (types, length)
  - other
- more "dynamic" rules:
  - enforce rules on certain conditions only (e.g. overall server usage)
  - adjust metrics dynamically
  - learning and permissive mode (server wide, per function)
- dynamic rule adjustment of the generic request filter
- re-design/re-implementation of some parts/functions
  + maybe dropping some features
  + remove other functions
  - maybe start the implementation of a separate module.
    > see mod_setenvifplus
- web interface to configure mod_qos dynamically
+ QS_ClientEventRequestLimit limits the number of concurrent
  events per client source IP.
- improved anomalie detection (thresholds, logging)
  - set client event to be used in other rules
- propagate client information via request header (set additional variables)
+ improved variable handling and propagation via header
+ deflate body
  + adjust content-length header (requires parp 0.8)
- new implementation of the QS_SrvMaxConnPerIP functionality (no tree anymore)
