01slow
===================
Application /b/index.cgi is "slow" (show how long it takes to load the 
whole page in the browser) while application /a runs normal.

disbaled:
 run 01slow.htt, many clients request application /b
 result: applications /a is no longer available
enabled:
 same, but mod_qos limits the max. number of concurrent requests to /b
 result: application /a is available

02download
===================
Many clients downloads an iso image. We have to limit the bandwith for
this resource.

disabled:
 run 02download.htt and show used bandwith in logs/stat.csv ~20mbit/sec (>3000000bytes/s)
enabled:
 run 02download.htt again and show how mod_qos manages the bandwith /qos?refresh
 result: logs/stat.csv shows limited bandwith (~1300000bytes/s => 10mbit/s)

03loic
===================
Server is no longer available to our clients du a TCP DoS attack.

disabled:
 Many clients open TCP connections and send data very slow just fast enough
 to prevent socket timeout. No application is available.
enabled:
 min. data rate/max connections per client/deny clients causing erros
 result: application is available

04session
===================
Client opens new sessions (get Cookie) but don't use them. This fills up
the memory of our session store. Users don't get new sessions anymore.
Show that the server opens a new session when posting the login form (even
authentication was not successful) using "Live HTTP headers".

disabled:
 Client may open as many connections as he wants.
enabled:
 mod_qos limits the number of cookies within a specified time (200 within 5 minutes)
 result: client can't access the application and therefore can't open new sessions

05bruteforce
===================
Login attemps with different username/password combinations.

disabled:
 Client my try as many combination as he wants.
enabled:
 mod_qos detects login attempts and blocks the client (max 100 per 5 minutes).
 result: client can't try other password combinations

05bruteforce_url
===================
Client searchs for vulnerable URLs or hidden features.

disabled:
 client may access invlid resources (404, 500, 403) as often he wants.
enabled:
 mod_qos limits the number of error responses, e.g. 404, disallowing
 crawling for "hidden" resources
