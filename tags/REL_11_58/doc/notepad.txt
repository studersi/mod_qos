+ study pcre and set match_limit
- re-implement (again) the per connection/ip list (supporting thousands of
  connections per server) (QS_SrvMaxConnPerIP)
- limit number of parameters (better to be implemented in mod_parp)
- improved anomaly detection, collecting additional client/connection
  attributes such as
  - requests per single TCP connection (keep-alive)
  + 304 responses
  - check if the client supports JavaScript (check by a test page, e.g. UserTracking extension)
    verification may be performed when server becomes busy/in conjunction with QS_ClientPrefer
    and we could also blacklist clients which are redirected to the test page multiple times
  + respone content types (html/css/js/image/...)
    - store/configure "normal" behavoir (stop learning after a while)
  - elapse time between requests
    + milestoes with min. time between req (think time of the user)
  - request/response length (body)
  - request/response headers (types, length)
  - request/response duration
  - other
  - log event
  - per user-agent (categories)
  + multiple "per client" event counter
    + combine these counters (if c1>n AND c2>m then c3++)
- new machine-readable status viewer (json,xml,...)
  - add statistics, e.g. how often a limit had been reached
    + error event counter
  - implement plugins to read the status viewer (e.g. for nagios)
  + scoreboard log message once every minute (json)
+ geo location
  + country
  - region, city. latitude/longitude
  - IPv6
+ doc: document VIP behavior (exact: which directive are affected)
+ add QS_ClientIpFromHeader support for QS_ClientEventRequestLimit 
- more "dynamic" rules:
  - enforce rules on certain conditions only (e.g. overall server usage)
    + QS_SrvMinDataRate <bytes per second> [<max bytes per second> [ <free>% ] ]
    + QS_SrvMaxConnPerIP <number> [<onnections>]
    + QS_CondClientEventLimitCount
    + QS_CondEventLimitCount
  - adjust metrics dynamically
  - learning and permissive mode
    + server wide (global)
    - per function
  + store metrics as environment variables (used by QS_EventRequestLimit,
    QS_CondLocRequestLimitMatch and others)
    + QS_SrvConn 
    + QS_ClientEventLimitCount value
    + counter used by QS_ClientEventLimitCount
    + counter used by QS_EventLimitCount
    + QS_ResponseDelayTime (logger only)
    - more variables
- dynamic rule adjustment for the generic request filter
  - "in module" learing (instead of qsfilter2)
  - or use separate application (java?) to generate rules (ICAP?)
  - automatic rule adjustment
    - privileged users/ip/??? to learn from automatically
  - crawler
  + reset of QS_ClientEventLimitCount counters
- request filter:
  + json in request query (not body)
  - gwt parser (req id to build parameter names?)
  - xml parser
  - qsfilter2 improvements
    - avoid certain pattern
    - different output formats
    - built-in (preferred) pattern ("expert mode")
- response filter (e.g. detecting "bad" js code)
  - try to enforce content security header settings
- support milestones on a per Location basis
+ Set IP differentiated services code points (DSCP)
- Change log message severity of errors caused by QS_SrvMinDataRate
  (mod_qos(034) events) if we did not receive any byte to avoid too 
  many event messages caused by browser's speculative preconnect requests
+ serialize requets per client
+ serialize requets per server
- more user friendly error handling for QS_ClientEventBlockCount directive
  - show the error page for more than only the first occurence
    - e.g. answer the next 5 (or more) requests with an error page too
      (instead of closing the TCP connection)
    - detect, if counter was incremented at http response, e.g. session cookie
       => show error page at next request
  - add more (user defined variable) QS_Block counter?
    + implemented for QS_ClientEventLimitCount
- re-design/re-implementation of some parts/functions
  + maybe dropping some features
    + remove QS_SrvPreferNet
    - other
  - maybe start the implementation of a separate module.
    + see mod_setenvifplus
    - mod_qos "light"
    - sepatate modules for some function sets
- web interface (handler) to configure mod_qos dynamically
  - improved viewer
  - console:
    + clear per client stats
    + block clients/IPs
    + mark clients as vip
- management tool (sep. application)
  - configuration guidance
    - documentation, mobile app?
  - topics:
    - concurrency limitation (QS_LocRequestLimitMatch)
    - response throttling (QS_LocKBytesPerSecLimitMatch (+QS_LocRequestLimitMatch))
    + denial of service defense: dos.html
    - session dos/brute foce attack defense
    - user tracking cookie for stats and to ensure client accepts cookies
    - ...
  - log data management
  - rule generation
  - utilities (ha/lb/...)
  + log data signing (using pipe: "|sig |qsrotate <file>")
    - for other software (java)
      + log4j 1.2
  - nms plugin (OpenNMS? Nagios?)
    - see https://github.com/dimovelev/metrics-sampler
- support IPv6
  + "real" IPv6 support
  - net vs host address rules
    + use "Remote_Net" provided by mod_setenvifplus
- propagate client information via request header (set additional variables)
  + using mod_setenvifplus
  + QS_SetReqHeader late
- decoding functions (UTF-8, non-standard MS/IIS %uXXYY, HTML, ANSI C, charset, other)
  - enhance qos_unescaping() (partial done)
  - document path_decode_hook()/query_decode_hook()
x initial socket timeout for new connections (tcp open only and no initial request)
  + QS_Timeout for reading the req body
+ QS_SrvMaxConnClose to support "percentage" of the MaxClient settings instead of abs. value
  - set variable mod_qos_con_ip (see mod_qos_con)
+ user tracking cookie (for statistics and cookie-check)
  + timeout/renew
+ gnu autotools to build tools
- full Apache 2.4 support
  - all features/directives
  - MPM "worker" and "event"
+ create request id if mod_unique_id is not available
+ enforce cookie support (redirect until client sends cookie), option for
  user tracking cookie or seperate cookie?
  + disable for certain user-agent headers (or X-Do-Not-Track header)
+ OpenSSL 1.0 support for qsfilter2 (safestack).
- make mod_qos more portable
  - use apr types and functions everywhere
  - e.g. use apr_time_t instead of time_t
+ qsrotate: daylight saving time support
x headerfilter: no duplicate req headers -> merged by Apache
+ fix regsub (2.2.22)
