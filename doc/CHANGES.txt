Version

 - Adds the option 'jsredirect' to the QS_UserTrackingCookieName directive:
   Client (browser) has to use the Javascript within the cookie check page
   to fetch the cookie and for redirect back to the initial request.
   Example: view-source:http://mod-qos.sourceforge.net/cookie-ir.shtml

Version 11.62

 - Machine-readable version of the status viewer does no longer
   show QS_SrvMaxConn* counters for virtual hosts using the base
   server's configuration and counter.

 - New directive QS_MaxClients.

Version 11.61

 - QS_SrvMaxConnPerIP can handle more than MaxClient IP addresses
   (if the server opens new connections faster than closing old)
   and enables memory block distribution by default.

Version 11.60

 - Fixed: Wrong connection counter (total server connections stored in the
   QS_AllConn variable) when using SrvMaxConn* directives globally only but
   other QS_* directives within virtual hosts. Bug influenced
   QS_SrvMinDataRate behavior as well (activating and increasing the min.
   data rate too fast).

Version 11.59

 - QS_EventRequestLimit writes the current counter value to the
   QS_EventRequestLimit_<env-variable>_Counter envrionment variable.

 - New directive QS_SetEnvIfCmp.

Version 11.58

 - Adds directive QS_UnsetReqHeader.

 - Removes version information in automake configure script (utilities).

Version 11.57

 - Adds qsrespeed and qsre (previous "regexspeed" and "regex" dev tool)
   to the support utilities.

Version 11.56

 - Non-functional: Changed QS_Status invocation timer implementation.

 - Adds qsdt (previous "duration" dev tool) to the support utilities.

Version 11.55

 - qslog: "-l" supports files with huge gaps (missing lines).

 - QS_SetEnvIf and QS_SetEnvIfQuery directives can be used within Location
   configuration.
 
Version 11.54

 - Introduces the QS_Block_Decrement variable.

Version 11.53

 - Adds CORS headers to the default QS_RequestHeaderFilter and
   QS_ResponseHeaderFilter rule set.

 - qslog: shows also the distribution of response durations faster than
   a second within the following intervals:
   * 0-49ms
   * 50-99ms
   * 100-499ms
   * 500-999ms
  
Version 11.52

 - Fixed: QS_LimitRequestBody did not work for chunked requests
   when used in Apache 2.4.

 - QS_Status uses the server's base configuration settings while logging
   allowing to configure a custom log format using ErrorLogFormat.
   
 - qssign's verification mode supports graceful restart (sigusr1) where
   two qssign processes are running (one with the old sequence
   counter and the new one starting at 1).
   
Version 11.51

 - Adds process-connection handler to close the connection in the case the
   abort by the pre-connect hook was ignored (workaround for bug in
   Apache 2.4.28 Event MPM ignoring the connection abort) (msg id 167).

 - Uses module name in log index.
 
Version 11.50

 - Changes pre-connection hook dependency (called later but still before
   mod_ssl).

Version 11.49

 - Adapted connection handling to deal with master/slave connections
   (introduced by Apache 2.4.18) avoiding inconsistent connection counters.

Version 11.48

 - Detects unexpected connection dispatching to old child process to avoid
   invalid connection counter state for QS_ClientPrefer rules (msg id 166).

Version 11.47

 - Updates built-in filter pattern of QS_HeaderFilter (Transfer-Encoding).

 - qslog standard mode supports peak/max value counter (M).

Version 11.45

 - QS_ClientEventRequestLimit supports the QS_ClientIpFromHeader directive.

Version 11.44

 - New directive QS_CondEventLimitCount.

 - QS_EventLimitCount (and QS_CondEventLimitCount) counter may be decremented
   by environment variable suffixed by "_Decrement".

 - Slightly changed unique-id generator (shorter).

Version 11.43

 - Fixed: QS_IsVipRequest was not set if QS_ClientPrefer hasn't been
   used.

Version 11.42c

 - qslog supports QSCOUNTERPATH (-pc mode) environment variable which
   defines a file containg a list of QS_ClientEventLimitCount rules.
   The 'E' format character defines the event string in the log
   to match (literal string) the event1 and event2 event names against.

   Rule syntax: <name>:<event1>-<n>*<event2>/<duration>=<limit>

   Example mod_qos config:
    QS_ClientEventLimitCount 20 600 QS_LimitEv
    QS_SetEnvRes Event AU04 QS_LimitEv
    QS_SetEnvRes Event AU05 QS_LimitEv_Decrement=2
   Sample qslog rule:
    QS_LimitEv:AU04-2*AU05/600=20

   Special us case mathing against the HTTP status code ('S' character)
   is used if the rule 'name' starts with STATUS.
   Example mod_qos configuration:
    QS_ClientEventLimitCount 10 300 QS_LimisS
    QS_SetEnvIfStatus 400 QS_LimitS=1
    QS_SetEnvIfStatus 405 QS_LimitS=1
    QS_SetEnvIfStatus 406 QS_LimitS=1
    QS_SetEnvIfStatus 408 QS_LimitS=1
    QS_SetEnvIfStatus 413 QS_LimitS=1
    QS_SetEnvIfStatus 414 QS_LimitS=1
    QS_SetEnvIfStatus 500 QS_LimitS=1
   Sample qslog rule:
    STATUS:400_405_406_408_413_414_500-1*X/300=10

Version 11.42

 - Message mod_qos(034) indicates (by "in:0") when the server not even
   received a request line on a TCP connection (potentially a speculative
   TCP pre-connection).

 - qslog -pc mode supports peak/max value counter (M).

 - qsrotate supports line-by-line data processing prefixing every line
   by a timestamp when using the option "-d", e.g. for batch/script 
   output logging.

 - qsrotate supports option "-m" to define the file permissions.

 - Header filter: accepts region specific language codes in 
   Accept-Language request header by default.

 - Compiles also against OpenSSL 1.1.0b.

Version 11.31

 - New variable "QS_Set_DSCP" to set the IP differentiated services code
   points (DiffServ / RFC 2474).

 - QS_RedirectIf also supports 301.

Version 11.26

 - Changed: QS_SrvMaxConn* directive counter's inheritance from the base
   server to virtual hosts is no longer coupled to other QS_* directive
   rules. This means, that a virtual host uses the very same counters
   as the base server as long as neither QS_SrvMaxConn, QS_SrvMaxConnClose,
   nor QS_SrvMaxConnPerIP has been configured within the virtual host.

   prior transformation (country code '-').

 - Fixed: QS_ClientIpFromHeader used to determine country code
   (QS_ClientGeoCountryDB) even the country could not be determined
   for the connection address (incomplete IP list).

Version 11.18

 - New directive QS_Status.

 - QS_SrvSampleRate must be greater then one second.

   the remaining time in seconds a client is still blocked (to be used
   within error pages to show a client how long he has to wait until he
   might proceed).

 - New variable QS_MaxKeepAliveRequests.

Version 11.11

 - QS_Limit (resp. the event variable processed by the

   QS_SrvMaxConnPerIP only).

Version 10.24

 - New directive QS_CondClientEventLimitCount.

 - Fixed: qsfilter2 did not compile with OpenSSL 1.0.0.

Version 9.29

 - Add Strict-Transport-Security to the default response header rules.

 - Directive QS_UserTrackingCookieName features an optional "path"
   attribute. This path specifies a local error page which is shown
   to users not accepting the user tracking cookie (note: search engines

   pools). Should fix the restart issues with MPM prefork binaries.

 - Renew user tracking cookie once every month.

Version 9.25

 - Compile utilities using GNU autotools (hope this works at least on
   some Linux platforms).

Version 9.24

 - QS_SrvMinConnPerIP: don't log every rule violation (consolidate log

   of 48bytes per client on a 32bit system).

 - Improved client level control (behavior detection, see above) is
   processed by the QS_ClientPrefer directive. Directive
   QS_ClientTolerance controls the allowed variation.

 - Directive QS_SrvPreferNet has been removed. It's recommended to use
   QS_ClientPrefer instead.

Version 8.18

 - Q2841328: remove nasty pointer address cast to int.

 - Fixed: Client prefer, don't mark connection timeout at keep alive
   end (used in conjunction with QS_ClientPrefer).

 - Access log events (mod_qos_ev, mod_qos_cr, mod_qos_con) are stored as

Version 7.13

 - Changed directive processing order, see mod_qos_seq.gif.

 - New directive QS_SetEnvIfParp (requires mod_parp,
   see http://parp.sourceforge.net).

   Important:
   mod_parp and the QS_SetEnvIfParp directive copies the whole HTTP
   request message body into the servers memory (requires at least
   twice the memory size of the posted data). It is very important
   that you limit the messagy body size for requests processed my
