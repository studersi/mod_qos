<p>
qsfilter2 is a log analyzer used to generate filter rules (perl 
compatible regular expressions) which may be used with mod_qos to
deny access for suspect request lines.

Usage: qsfilter2 -i &lt;path&gt; [-c &lt;path&gt;] [-d &lt;num&gt;] [-h] [-b &lt;num&gt;] [-p|-s|-m|-o] [-l &lt;len&gt;] [-n] [-e] [-u 'uni'] [-k &lt;prefix&gt;] [-t]


Summary
 mod_qos implements a request filter which validates each request
 line. The module supports both, negative and positive security
 models. The QS_Deny* directives are used to specify request line
 patterns which are not allowed to access the server (negative
 security model / blacklist). These rules are used to restrict
 access to certain resources which should not be available to
 users or to protect the server from malicious patterns. The
 QS_Permit* rules implement a positive security model (whitelist).
 These directives are used to define allowed request line patterns.
 Requests which do not match any of these patterns are not allowed
 to access the server.
 qsfilter2 is used to generate filter rules based on audit log
 data. It parses existing audit or access log files in order to
 generate rule patterns covering all allowed requests. These rules
 (QS_PermitUri directives and patterns) may be used by mod_qos to
 deny access for suspect request lines.

Options
  -i &lt;path&gt;
     Input file containing request URIs.
     The URIs for this file have to be extracted from the server's
     access logs. Each line of the input file contains a request
     URI consisting of a path and a query.
     Example:

       /aaa/index.do
       /aaa/edit?image=1.jpg
       /aaa/image/1.jpg
       /aaa/view?page=1
       /aaa/edit?document=1

     This log data must include current request URIs, but
     also request lines from previous rule generation steps. It
     must also include request lines which cover manually generated
     rules.
  -c &lt;path&gt;
     mod_qos configuration file defining QS_DenyRequestLine and
     QS_PermitUri directives.
     qsfilter2 generates rules from access log data automatically.
     Manually generated rules (QS_PermitUri) may be provided from
     this file. Note: each manual rule must be represented by a
     request URI in the input data (-i) in order to make sure not
     to be deleted by the rule optimization algorithm.
     QS_Deny* rules from this file are used to filter request lines
     which should not be used for whitelist rule generation.
     Example:

       # manually defined whitelist rule:
       QS_PermitUri +view deny "^[/a-zA-Z0-9]+/view\?(page=[0-9]+)?$"
       # filter unwanted request line patterns:
       QS_DenyRequestLine +printable deny ".*[\x00-\x19].*"

  -d &lt;num&gt;
     Depth (sub locations) of the path string which is defined as a
     literal string. Default is 1.
  -h
     Always use a string representing the handler name in the path even
     if the url does not have a query. See also -d option.
  -b &lt;num&gt;
     Replaces url pattern by the regular expression when detecting
     a base64/hex encoded string. Detecting sensibility is defined by
     a numeric value. You should use values higher than 5 (default)
     or 0 to disable this function.
  -p
     Represents query by pcre only (no literal strings).
  -s
     Uses one single pcre for the whole query string.
  -m
     Uses one pcre for multiple query values (recommended mode).
  -o
     Does not care about the order of query parameters.
  -l &lt;len&gt;
     Outsizes the query length by the defined length ({0,size+len}),
     default is 10.
  -n
     Disables redundant rules elimination.
  -e
     Exit on error.
  -u 'uni'
     Defines additional decoding methods. Use the same setting as you
     have used for the QS_Decoding directive.
  -k
     Prefix used to generate rule identifiers (QSF by default).
  -t
     Determines the worst case performance for the generated whitelist
     by applying each rule for each request line (output is real time
     filter duration per request line in milliseconds).

Output
 The output of qsfilter2 is written to stdout. The output
 contains the generated QS_PermitUri directives but also
 information about the source which has been used to generate
 these rules. It is very important to check the validity of
 each request line which has been used to calculate the
 QS_PermitUri rules. Each request line which has been used to
 generate a new rule is shown in the output prefixed by
 "ADD line &lt;line number&gt;:". These request lines should be
 stored and reused at any later rule generation (add them to
 the URI input file). The subsequent line shows the generated
 rule.
 At the end of data processing a list of all generated
 QS_PermitUri rules is shown. These directives may be used
 within the configuration file used by mod_qos.

Sample Usage and Output
  ./qsfilter2 -i loc.txt -c httpd.conf -m -e
  ...
  # ADD line 1: /aaa/index.do
  # 003 ^(/[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+)+[/]?\.?[a-zA-Z]{0,4}$
  # ADD line 3: /aaa/view?page=1
  # --- ^[/a-zA-Z0-9]+/view\?(page=[0-9]+)?$
  # ADD line 4: /aaa/edit?document=1
  # 004 ^[/a-zA-Z]+/edit\?((document)(=[0-9]*)*[&]?)*$
  # ADD line 5: /aaa/edit?image=1.jpg
  # 005 ^[/a-zA-Z]+/edit\?((image)(=[0-9\.a-zA-Z]*)*[&]?)*$
  ...
  QS_PermitUri +QSF001 deny "^[/a-zA-Z]+/edit\?((document|image)(=[0-9\.a-zA-Z]*)*[&]?)*$"
  QS_PermitUri +QSF002 deny "^[/a-zA-Z0-9]+/view\?(page=[0-9]+)?$"
  QS_PermitUri +QSF003 deny "^(/[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+)+[/]?\.?[a-zA-Z]{0,4}$"
